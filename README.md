# Earthquake Management Process - Scheduling Algorithms Simulation Tool

## Overview
This is a website built to visualize CPU Scheduling processes using an interactive Earthquake Simulation model. Every aspect of the Earthquake management contains one of the scheduling algorithms in it's core, which makes it an overall cohesive simulation.

## Scheduling Processes
1. Evacuation - FCFS
2. First-Aid - Priority
3. Medical Camp - Round-Robin
4. Food Collection - SJF
5. Food Distribution - FCFS
6. Damage Repair - SJF

## Execution
Once the project is downloaded or cloned, run ```npm start``` to start the tool.
